## MobSF (https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF)
- Pentesting framework capable of performing static analysis, dynamic analysis (only android), malware analysis and web API testing.

- Run on Windows/Linux/Mac.

- Test android, iOS and Windows apps (.apk/.ipa/.appx, respectively).



## Qark (https://github.com/linkedin/qark)
- Designed to look for several security related Android application vulnerabilities, either in source code or packaged APKs.

- Capable of creating "Proof-of-Concept" deployable APKs and/or ADB commands, capable of exploiting many of the vulnerabilities it finds. 

- Must run on Windows/Linux/Mac.

- Test only android apps (.apk).



## Androbugs
- Helps developers or hackers find potential security vulnerabilities in Android applications.

- Run on Windows/Linux/Mac.

- Test only android apps (.apk).




## SUPER (https://github.com/SUPERAndroidAnalyzer/super)
- Use Rust as programming language;
	- Why? 
	Does not depend in JVM or JIT compilers, and stack overflows, segmentation faults etc. are directly not possible, which makes sense in a security centered application. And secondly, we decided to make the software 100% extensible: All rules are centered in a rules.json file, and each company or tester could create its own rules to analyze what they need.

- Run on Windows/Linux/Mac.

- Test only android apps (.apk).

- Perform static analysis based on rules.json file

- Download (Linux):

## FindBugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)
- Program which uses static analysis to look for bugs in Java code.

- Can be usefully and must be running after apk2java.

- Run on Windows/Linux/Mac.




## Drozer (https://github.com/mwrlabs/drozer)
- Security testing framework for Android.

- Run on Windows/Linux/Mac.

- Test only android apps (.apk).




## Androwarn (https://github.com/maaaaz/androwarn)
- Perform static analysis 

- Run on Windows/Linux/Mac.

- Test only android apps (.apk)





## Tamer (https://tools.androidtamer.com/)
- Android Tamer is a Virtual / Live Platform for Android Security Professionals.

- It's a distro.

- Focused on android apps, but have tools that analize iOS and Windows apps.

- Suggested sequency of tools execution over android apk:
	- apk2java: apk2java <something>.apk
	- drozer_check.sh: drozer_check.sh <something>.diva
	- adb list
	- mobsf
